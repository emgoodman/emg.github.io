    <p>
      Hi, I'm Emily and I am passionate about leveraging my background in environmental education and conservation with my technical geospatial skills to connect people with information.
    </p>

    <p>In my spare time I like to travel and go backpacking. I recently started playing soccer and I love to be outdoors as much as possible.</p>

      <p>I'm excited to learn more about web mapping applications. I love the creative problem solving in GIS and configuring data on a map for targeted audiences. I love the shortcuts you can use by introducing coding, something I'd like to get better at. Although ArcGIS can be infuriating, the end result is worth it. In the future, it will be cool to see people using a map I've made that they got something useful out of. I will be completing my GIS certificate this spring.
