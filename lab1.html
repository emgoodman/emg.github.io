    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Emily- first of her name, seeker of adventures, lover of chocolate, writer of words, singer of showers and empty rooms. My favorite Pokemon is dogs.
    </p>
    
    <p>In my spare time I like to travel and go backpacking. I moved back to Brooklyn last year so I've been acclimating to the city life again and I get to spend more time with my family. I'm looking forward to a longer autumn, haunted hayrides, apple picking, and cider donuts. My friends in Colorado have never tasted cider donuts before. Yes, they are a thing, and yes, they are delicious.
