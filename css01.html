    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Emily- first of her name, seeker of adventures, lover of chocolate, writer of words, singer of showers and empty rooms. My favorite Pokemon is dogs.
    </p>

    <p>In my spare time I like to travel and go backpacking. I moved back to Brooklyn last year so I've been acclimating to the city life again and have been spending more time with my family. I'm looking forward to a longer autumn season, haunted hayrides, apple picking, and apple cider donuts. My friends in Colorado have never tasted cider donuts before. Yes, they are a thing. Yes, they are delicious. Get yourself some apple cider donuts already. I also enjoy music, reading, movies, and playing video games.</p>

    <h4>All Things GIS</h4>
    <p>I'm excited to learn more about web mapping applications. I have only used html during the MySpace days (totally dating myself here), so I'm ready to learn more. I love the creative problem solving in GIS and configuring data on a map for targeted audiences. I love the shortcuts you can use by introducing coding, something I'd like to get better at. Although ArcGIS can be infuriating, the end result is worth it. In the future, it will be cool to see people using a map I've made that they got something useful out of. I will be completing my GIS certificate this spring.

    <p>Here is a project I created for class:</p>
